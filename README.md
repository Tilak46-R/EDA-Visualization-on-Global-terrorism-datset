**Dashboarding on Global Terrorism Database using Tableau**

**Introduction:**

This repository contains Tableau dashboards created for visualizing data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The GTD is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017 (as of the last update of this README).

**Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive and insightful visualization of global terrorism data. By utilizing Tableau's powerful visualization tools, users can explore various aspects of terrorist attacks such as trends over time, geographical distribution, attack types, and more.

**Repository Structure**

data/: Contains the datasets used for the visualization. The primary dataset is the Global Terrorism Database in CSV format.
images/: Any images or screenshots used in the README or elsewhere in the project.
Tableau_Workbook/: Includes the Tableau workbook file (.twb) containing the dashboards and associated visualizations.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.

**Dashboard Features:**

The Tableau dashboard includes the following features:

**Global Overview:** A world map showcasing the distribution of terrorist attacks globally. Users can filter the data by year, region, or country.

**Time Trends**: A time series chart illustrating the number of terrorist attacks over the years. Users can analyze trends, spikes, or declines in terrorism activities.

**Attack Types:** A bar chart showing the distribution of attack types (e.g., bombing, assassination, hijacking). Users can identify the most prevalent types of attacks.

**Casualties Analysis:** Visualizes the number of casualties (both fatalities and injuries) caused by terrorist attacks. Users can understand the severity of attacks in terms of human impact.

**Target Types:** Shows the types of targets that terrorists aim for (e.g., civilians, military, government). Users can gain insights into the preferences or strategies of terrorist groups.

**Group Analysis:** Provides information on the most active terrorist groups and their attributed attacks. Users can explore the groups responsible for a significant portion of the attacks.

**Usage:**

**Tableau Desktop:** Download the Tableau workbook (.twb) file from this repository and open it using Tableau Desktop.
**
****Data Source:** Ensure that the CSV file containing the Global Terrorism Database is accessible. If needed, adjust the data source connection in Tableau to point to the correct file location.

**Interact with Dashboards:** Explore the dashboards by interacting with various filters, parameters, and visualizations. Gain insights into global terrorism trends and patterns.

**Contribution**

Contributions to enhance the visualizations, add new features, or improve the analysis are welcome. If you wish to contribute, please fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
